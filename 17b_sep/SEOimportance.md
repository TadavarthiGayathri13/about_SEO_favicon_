SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It's the practice of improving your website to increase its visibility when people search online using search engines like Google and Bing.

Here's why SEO is important:

1) Increased Visibility: Most users never look past the first page of search results. SEO helps your website rank higher, making it more likely people will see it and click through.

2) Structure and Clarity:  HTML provides the structure for your webpages using tags that define headings, paragraphs, lists, and other elements. This clear structure helps search engines crawl and index your content effectively.

3) Keywords and Metadata:  Certain HTML elements allow you to embed keywords and meta descriptions relevant to your content. Title tags, meta descriptions, and header tags all use HTML and can be optimized to improve search ranking.

4) Image Optimization:  While not directly related to SEO, HTML includes alt tags for images. These alt tags provide descriptions for images and can be optimized with relevant keywords to improve image search ranking.

In essence, well-structured and semantic HTML code acts as a foundation for SEO. It ensures search engines can properly crawl and understand your website's content, which is crucial for effective SEO practices.
